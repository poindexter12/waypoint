# Worktree: REPLACE_WITH_WORKTREE_NAME

**Branch:** `REPLACE_WITH_BRANCH_NAME`
**Mode:** `REPLACE_WITH_MODE`
**Created:** REPLACE_WITH_TIMESTAMP

## Purpose

REPLACE_WITH_DESCRIPTION (or "No description provided")

## Mode Semantics

- **main**: Minimal changes, stable work only
  - Use for: Production code, critical hotfixes
  - Restrictions: No experimentation, minimal scope
  - AI Behavior: Conservative, safety-focused

- **feature**: Active development, larger changes allowed
  - Use for: New features, enhancements, most development
  - Restrictions: None - be creative!
  - AI Behavior: Helpful, proactive suggestions

- **bugfix**: Isolated, surgical fixes only
  - Use for: Specific bug fixes, targeted corrections
  - Restrictions: Minimal scope, no unrelated changes
  - AI Behavior: Focused, warns about scope creep

- **experiment**: Prototypes, large swings, unsafe changes allowed
  - Use for: POCs, technology spikes, learning
  - Restrictions: None - can be messy
  - AI Behavior: Aggressive suggestions, OK with rough code

- **review**: Documentation, analysis, audits
  - Use for: Code review, security audits, understanding code
  - Restrictions: Read-only mindset
  - AI Behavior: Analytical, critical feedback

## About This Worktree

This directory is an independent Git worktree attached to the main repository.

- **Main repository:** REPLACE_WITH_MAIN_REPO_PATH
- **Worktree path:** REPLACE_WITH_WORKTREE_PATH
- **Branch:** REPLACE_WITH_BRANCH_NAME
- **Git directory:** Linked to main repository `.git/`

### What is a Git Worktree?

A git worktree allows you to check out multiple branches simultaneously in separate directories. All worktrees share the same repository history but have independent working directories.

**Benefits:**
- No need to `git stash` when switching contexts
- Work on multiple features in parallel
- Isolated dependencies and build artifacts
- Fast context switching (just `cd` to different directory)

### Metadata Files

**`.ai-context.json`** (Machine-Readable)
- JSON format for AI tools
- Contains: worktree, branch, mode, created, description
- Read automatically by Claude and other AI tools

**`README.working-tree.md`** (This File)
- Human-readable documentation
- Explains mode semantics and worktree info
- Generated automatically by `/wtm-new` or `/wtm-adopt`

## Quick Commands

### View Status
```bash
/wtm-status
```
Show metadata for current worktree.

### List All Worktrees
```bash
/wtm-list
```
See all worktrees in this repository with their metadata.

### Remove This Worktree
```bash
cd REPLACE_WITH_MAIN_REPO_PATH
/wtm-destroy REPLACE_WITH_WORKTREE_PATH
```
Safely remove this worktree (preserves branch).

### Update Metadata
```bash
/wtm-adopt --description "New description"
```
Update mode or description for this worktree.

## Workflow Tips

### Switching Between Worktrees
```bash
# From this worktree to another
cd ../other-worktree-name

# Back to this worktree
cd REPLACE_WITH_WORKTREE_PATH
```

### Committing Changes
```bash
# Normal git workflow
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push origin REPLACE_WITH_BRANCH_NAME
```

### Creating Pull Request
```bash
# After pushing commits
git push origin REPLACE_WITH_BRANCH_NAME
# Then create PR in GitHub/GitLab
```

### When Done With This Worktree
```bash
# 1. Ensure all changes are committed
git status

# 2. Push to remote
git push origin REPLACE_WITH_BRANCH_NAME

# 3. Create and merge PR

# 4. Remove worktree
cd REPLACE_WITH_MAIN_REPO_PATH
/wtm-destroy REPLACE_WITH_WORKTREE_PATH

# 5. Optionally delete branch after PR merge
git branch -d REPLACE_WITH_BRANCH_NAME
```
